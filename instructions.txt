Running the system:

Running the application itself:

First thing you must do is install dependencies. Ideally, you are working with an IDE that will
parse the `pom.xml` and automatically fetch the deps.

But if you wish to go the command line approach - from the project root directory, run the following:

`mvn compile`
`mvn assembly:single`

This should build the jar for you.

It can be accessed @ `target/a3-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

If you have an IDE, you can run the server by launching `src/main/java/BootServerThread`.

Alternatively, it's also provided as a JAR in the artifacts section

`java -jar out/artifacts/a3_jar/a3.jar`
