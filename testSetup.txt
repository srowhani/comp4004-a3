a)
Used Selenium + Junit for acceptance testing
    Purpose was testing the UI
    Location:
        acceptance/UITests
Used Junit for unit testing strategies.
    Purpose was testing specific details of each strat.
    Location:
        unit/algo/*

b)
I've included an mp4 of the tests running @ project base directory. If you're not able to run an mp4 file:

If you have chrome you should be able to drag and drop into window - and it will play.
I've sped it up, so you don't have to watch 2 minutes of ui testing.

There's also a screenshot of the test suite. In intellij, you can run a suite by running the folder.

If you wish to run the tests on Eclipse
    - right clicking the file, and selecting run as Junit test should also work.
